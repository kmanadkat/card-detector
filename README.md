## Card Detector - React Js & Tailwind CSS

[Preview on Netlify](https://card-detector.netlify.app/)

### üìú Overview

This is a mini project built witb React Js and Tailwind CSS. It majorly demonstrates how we can control input fields leveraging Javascript and breaking down UI in chunk of components using React Js framework.

Based on the input card number, it detects type of card from following category:

1. Master Card
2. Visa
3. Maestro
4. RuPay

> The default card type is set to Visa. The card information shown in below snapshot is sample content - not real, do not waste your time üòÑ

Detection happens using the utility function `getCardType` in `/src/utils/cardTypes.js`. Behind the scenes it is Regex based detection.
